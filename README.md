# weatherly

## An exercise in API calls

This simple site gathers the user's location (gathered locally, not stored), makes a call to [Darksky](https://darksky.net/poweredby/) and [Sunrise Sunset's](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) API to find  the current weather and sunrise/sunset. Using this as a testing ground for some stuff so other APIs will probably show up at some point.
